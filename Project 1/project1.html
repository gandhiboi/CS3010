        <h3>01/03/2019</h3>
        <p>
            Over the course of this year, I will be traveling to various cities throughout the world and
            sharing my new experiences! Just before the start of the new year, I had traveled to Bosnia and
            Herzegovina. It was me and my family's first time back since we moved to the United States in 2001.
            First, we visited Kotor Varoš which is my mom's birth city. We primarily went there to visit my uncle and
            other close family relatives on her side. After about a week there, my family and I traveled to Sarajevo,
            the city where me and my sisters were born. It was absolutely mesmerizing. It all felt as if it was a dream.
            From the pictures displayed, you can see the true beauty of Bosnia. The first and second in image in the
            first column are pictures from our apartment building. The third image in the column is from Kotor Varoš,
            when my uncle took me on a walk around the "downtown" area of the city. The first image in the second column
            is the 1984 Olympic Stadium in Sarajevo. The image below the stadium is of the largest river in Bosnia, the
            Miljacka. The third image in the column is of Jajce. I took the photo on the bus ride from Sarajevo to
            Kotor Varoš. And, the last image in the second column is of some sketchy, ice-covered bridge that I saw when
            I went on a walk.
